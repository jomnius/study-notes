# Welcome to Jomnius Study Notes

Read somewhere how a person was studying 15-30 minutes a day, about 5 times a week. She didn't have any detailed long-term plans, just something for the next few weeks. Insert [link](https://google.com) when I find it again.

So I decided to try the same system. Here are some notes for some of the bigger, more concentrated, studies. Now just trying out the online format, currently my real study notes are in a big black notebook (with paper and pen).
