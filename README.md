# Welcome to Jomnius Study Notes

```
The secret of getting ahead
is getting started.

-- Mark Twain
```

Read somewhere how this person was studying about 15-30 minutes a day, about 5 times a week. She didn't have any detailed long-term plans, just general idea for the next few weeks, because when you start reading something and check references or additional info, you're suddenly somewhere completely different subject.

Insert [link](https://google.com) when I find it again.

So I decided to try similar system. Here are some notes for some of the bigger, more concentrated, studies.

Now experimenting with the online format, my real study notes are in a physical big black notebook (with real paper and real pen). Most of my notes are just titles and subtitles from original article or video, exact quotes of important text and also source code, there is no point copying it here, too.

The value of writing things down is to make it easier for me to remember something afterwards. However I have checked my notes a few times, mainly to find out which of the many similar articles did I actually read.

Now I'm thinking that I could put here tags and summary, maybe the key discovery or why I read the thing in the first place. That would be kind of meta notes of study notes.
